## Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm **Job**

Hello there, I'm Job, a seasoned professional with a background in Computer Systems Engineering. While my journey took an unexpected turn to the railways, where I've proudly served as a Railway Supervisor for the past 14 years, my heart has always been drawn to the world of coding and web development.

Currently overseeing operations in North America's foremost railway network, I lead a dedicated team in solving complex challenges related to operations, logistics, safety, and quality. Together, we thrive on innovation, turning daily hurdles into opportunities for improvement.

Excitingly, I'm embarking on a new chapter, rediscovering my passion for programming. Starting by reviving unfinished PHP projects from my university days, I'm on a mission to explore and master new languages and technologies. My goal is to blend the precision of railway expertise with the creativity of coding, creating solutions that make a tangible impact on user experiences and startup initiatives.
I'm open to collaboration and eager to connect with like-minded individuals who share a passion for problem-solving and technological innovation. Let's build something great together at the intersection of railway operations and cutting-edge programming!
