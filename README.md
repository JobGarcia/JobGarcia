## Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm **Job**

A seasoned professional with a background in Computer Systems Engineering :technologist:. While my journey took an unexpected turn to the railways:railway_track:, where I've proudly served as a Railway Supervisor for the past 14 years. But my :heart: has always been drawn to the world of coding and web development :desktop_computer:.

Currently overseeing operations in North America's foremost railway network :steam_locomotive::railway_car::train:, I lead a dedicated team in solving complex challenges related to: 
:wrench: _operations_, :clipboard: _logistics_, :safety_vest: _safety_ and :label: _quality_. Together, we thrive on innovation, turning daily hurdles into opportunities for improvement.

:partying_face: Excitingly, I'm embarking on a new chapter, rediscovering my passion for programming. Starting by reviving unfinished PHP :elephant: projects from my university days :man_student:, I'm on a mission to explore and master new languages and technologies. My goal is to blend the precision of railway expertise :mechanic: with the creativity of coding :keyboard:, creating solutions that make a tangible impact :rocket: on user experiences and startup initiatives.
I'm open to collaboration and eager to connect :earth_americas: with like-minded individuals who share a passion for problem-solving :male_detective: and technological innovation :handshake:. 

:walking_man: Let's build something great together at the intersection of railway operations and cutting-edge programming! :kiwi_fruit:
